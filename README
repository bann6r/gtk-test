i thought qt was kinda complicated and time-wasting, so i found a widget toolkit that looks as easier than i thought but not sure if its easier said than done. its used for built-in gnome applications, and ive tried them before (debian 12), so i think this is great, and thats why im here making my very own small gtk application
this project uses gtk4
